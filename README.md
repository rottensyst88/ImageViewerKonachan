## KonaJar (Written in Java, that's why the "Jar"... gosh, I'm **sooo** funny)
### A wallpaper viewer and manager for downloading wallpapers from Konachan.com

I need to tranlate this to english, sorry for the inconvenience.

This project was created mainly to:
1. Practice object-oriented programming in Java,
2. Learn how to use GitHub properly... and
3. Because I like using Konachan.com, and I had nothing better to do during vacation.

I plan to keep updating the project... but no promises.
